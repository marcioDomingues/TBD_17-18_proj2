Project 2 - NoSQL

This is an open-ended project.

The goal is for each team to present a 10 minute demo of a NoSQL database of their choice.

Teams are responsible for finding a dataset for the demo (a transformation of the dellstore dataset can be used if no other suitable alternative is found). The teams should select the appopriate NoSQL open-source database for their data domain, load the data into a database server and perform a few operations as part of the demo.

The demo should have 2 parts: (1) a few slides describing the data, why the team selected the NoSQL database they are using, and how the data was loaded: (2) whenever possible, the 2nd part of the demo should be a live demo with operations being run during the demo. If this is not possible, the demo should mimick a live demo with slides demonstrating the operations and their results and run times.

 Presentations:

December, 18.

Groups will be distributed to present during their TP class or the Lecture.
